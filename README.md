# InsurancePlan
New Product pitch. As part of a hackathon we created a new chatbot which would ask the required information from a new user who's looking to start a new business. In the backend the bot would use machine learning Knn algorithm to go through an existing client base and finding clients with a similar profile. The insurance plans taken by these clients are then recommended to the new customer along with premiums considering various risk factors. 
Techstack:
Python (Knn algorithm, recommender), Amazon Lex, AWS Elastic BeanStalk, AWS IAM, Flask
